# LeutaTester by ThatMintyLad
## Early Access - Under Construction

In the UI, there's a text area, type your code, then click **Run**.
**Toggle** makes the text area invisible
**Clear** resets output and text area
# Problems and issues
* The JavaScript code is unable to run anything that has a class... What if I store the output as an "iFrame" 
* # Do not use this software for AI testing.
