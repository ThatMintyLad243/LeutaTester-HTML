# How to use
In the UI, there's a text area, type your code, then click **Run**.
**Toggle** makes the text area invisible
**Clear** resets the output and the text area
---
# How does it work?
* When you press **Run**, what's written in the textbox (HTML, CSS and JS) will be converted to Base64 and it gets set as the 'src' attribute of an iframe that takes the whole screen (before the Base64 data it adds "data:text/html;base64,")
